                  <p>Take in mind this is only what to come, I released
                  it as I finnaly got the inventory to somewhat work, it's a 				   little bit messy (which I am working on), it'll either be   
                  fixed in 1.0.0 or will be fixed in 1.0.1 or 1.0.2
                  depending on how long it will take. You cannot move items   
                  from slot to slot (but you can select items and items 
                  stack). </p>
                  
                  <br>
                  
                  <p>The roadmap will be later in thi article, but 1.1 
                  should hopefully have a lot of survival elemnts and we aim 				   for 1.1 to be either next week or the week afterwards, 
                  this weekend will be spent probbaly bug fixing and such 					  . Crafting may or may not be in 1.1, there is a very very 				  wip crafting menu (which is hidden in 1.0), you can 						  enable it with the debug option in the config file 						  though!</p>
                  
                  <p>Yeah Performance is rather put quite, shit it's a work 				  in progress it's okay but not great.</p>

                <div class="content">

                  <p>Okay this first of all here is what I have worked on today! </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Culling of blocks</li>
                    <li>Bigger islands</li>
                    <li>Conntinued work on messaging!</li>
                  </ul>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    Also I worked a simple chat app (which uses the same code as islandworld will use for chat).
                    Also the game will hopefully work on under 56kbps connections for multiplayer (and this website)
                  </p>

                  <p>This is primarly for the launcher as we may only use basic HTML and CSS
                    as swing was made in the 2000s or early 90s iirc!
